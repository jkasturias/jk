      <p>The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency. Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose. - BILL GATES</p>

      <p>Don't compare yourself with anyone in this world…if you do so, you are insulting yourself. If you are born poor it's not your mistake, but if you die poor it's your mistake. Life is not fair, get used to it! -BILL GATES</p>
